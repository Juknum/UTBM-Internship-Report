## I. Support

This template can be used in several places:

- Online with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)
- Locally on Windows/MacOS/Linux

---

## II. Features

> **Warning**  
> This template is free to use, but the covers belongs to the [UTBM](https://www.utbm.fr/) and can only be used with their authorization.  

> **Note**  
> UTBM and all UTBM-related trademarks and logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of the [University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard](https://www.utbm.fr/) in France, other countries, or both.

### UTBM's Covers

You can find all configurable options of UTBM covers within the below code, but if you feel unhappy you can still edit the covers [with this file here](https://github.com/Juknum/UTBM-Internship-Report/blob/main/libs/utbmcovers.sty).  
<!-- Code block mention (GitHub markdown feature) -->

https://github.com/Juknum/UTBM-Internship-Report/blob/108d23dee1516941a37bd0aa2fcbf109c8e18f6c/main.tex#L32-L55  

You can also modify their colors using those variables:

Finally you can call both covers using:

```tex
\makeutbmfrontcover{} % Front cover
\makeutbmbackcover{}  % & Back cover
```

Covers support english and french languages, you can change the language using the `babel` package:

```tex
\usepackage[english]{babel} % English
\usepackage[french]{babel}  % French
```

#### Part A: LaTeX distribution

You will need a LaTeX distribution to compile this project locally, here is a list of tested and working distributions for this project:

<table>
<tr>

  <img src="https://github.com/Juknum/UTBM-Internship-Report/assets/49886317/2162967b-c3ff-4c70-94cd-ce5a31156814"  height="16" style="margin: 0 6px -2px 0;">
  MiKTeX
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="https://miktex.org/download">Website</a> — <a href="https://miktex.org/download">Download</a>

Easy to install <u>but does not ship with Perl which the `latexmk` package requires.</u>

1. Install MiKTeX using the above link. Then you have the option to upgrade your installation to a standard TeX system. Just click the `Upgrade` button. Please be aware that this starts a ~200MB download.  
_Alternatively, you can turn on the auto-install feature and let MiKTeX install missing packages on-the-fly. You can find this option in the Settings tab._

<h5>On Windows</h5> 

2. You can install Perl using **Strawberry Perl**, which is available [here](http://strawberryperl.com/).  
    Once it's installed, you can verify that Perl is available by opening a new command prompt and typing `perl -v`. If it's installed correctly, you should see the version of Perl that you installed.

3. Verify that both Perl and MiKTeX are in your `PATH` and restart any open command prompts.

4. You should now be able to compile your $LaTeX$ files using MiKTeX.

<h5>On MacOS</h5>

2. You can install Perl using **Homebrew**, which is available [here](https://brew.sh/). 

    ```bash
    brew install perl  
    ```

    Once it's installed, you can verify that Perl is available by opening a new terminal and typing `perl -v`. If it's installed correctly, you should see the version of Perl that you installed.

3. Add `~/bin` to your `PATH` by adding the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file: 

    ```bash
    export PATH="/Users/<username>/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    > **Warning**  
    > Here we use the full path instead of using `~/bin` or `$HOME/bin` because the `~` and `$HOME` variables does not works if used in combination with the VS Code `latex-workshop` extension.

4. You should now be able to compile your $LaTeX$ files using MiKTeX.

Really popular $TeX$ distribution. The installation process despite being quite long enable the direct use and compilation of a project using this repository in VSCode as explained later. 
<h5>On Windows</h5>

Follow the <a href="https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html">link</a>, download `install-tl-windows.exe` and install the distribution exactly like any program.



<h5>On MacOs (MacTex)</h5>

> **Warning**   
> The name is different but it is done by the same team of programmers. It has **not** been tested whether the operating conditions are identical than on windows. Let us know if you are in this situation. 

An installation and use guide is available <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/">here</a>

#### Part B: IDE

After installing a LaTeX distribution, you will need an IDE to edit and compile your $LaTeX$ files, here is a list of tested and working IDEs for this project:

<table>

    <th>
      <img src="https://github.com/Juknum/UTBM-Internship-Report/assets/49886317/dba03968-0b1a-4812-a82d-742ffc8c31a8"  height="16" style="margin: 0 6px -2px 0;">
      Visual Studio Code
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Website</a>

This template **require** the use of the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension to compile the $LaTeX$ files directly within VS Code.

While they are not required to use the template, the following extensions are recommended for some Quality of Life improvements:

- 🔸 [LaTeX Utilities](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tecosaur.latex-utilities) - Useful extension to extends capabilities of LaTeX Workshop.
- 🪄 [LaTeX Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nickfode.latex-formatter) - Appreciate a more user friendly code base.
- 🔦 [LaTeX language support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=torn4dom4n.latex-support) - This extension adds syntax highlighting for LaTeX files.
- 📗 [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - Don't let typos slip through the cracks.

To compile the report, you can use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> shortcut or the `LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX project` command inside Visual Studio Code.

> **Note**  
> More information on the LaTex Workshop extension can be found [here](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install).
    </td>
    
> You can open and use this project by opening the folder in the source control menu (on the left hand side of the interface) and using this   link : `https://github.com/Juknum/UTBM-Internship-Report.git`
